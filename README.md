# Cat Photo App 🐱

This is my first HTML project — the **FreeCodeCamp Cat Photo App**.  
I built it while learning basic HTML structure, tags, and elements.

## 🧱 Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS (optional, if you added styling)

## 💡 What I Learned
- How to use HTML elements like `<img>`, `<a>`, `<form>`, and `<input>`.
- How to structure a simple webpage.

## 🌍 Live Demo
Once I enable GitHub Pages, the link will appear here.
