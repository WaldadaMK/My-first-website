# My First Website - Cat Photo App 🐱

This is my first ever HTML project from FreeCodeCamp.  
It’s a simple cat photo app that I built while learning how to use basic HTML tags.

## What I used
- HTML only 

## What I learned
I learned how to:
- Add images and links  
- Create forms and inputs  
- Write clean and organized code

## About this project
I’m learning web development and this is one of my practice projects.  
More projects coming soon as I keep learning!
